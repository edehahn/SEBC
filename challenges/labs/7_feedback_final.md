From my point of view the bootcamp offered a lot. Not just gaining some practical experience, but also a lot of useful material for digging deeper and studying.

Also, your concept of simulating time pressure and stress works, paying attention to the introduction of the next lab while still finishing previous labs requires high attention the whole time. So the week was intense and stuffed with input, I appreciated a lot.

One point you might improve is following closer the work of single persons in order to keep them a little bit better on track. From what I understood there where several persons who did not finish the labs because they lost whole days in single labs (TLS). I think would be nice to remove obstacles or ask people to skip a lab much earlier than at the late afternoon the day before the challenge.

Thank you very much!
